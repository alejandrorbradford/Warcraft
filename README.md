#Warcraft III Barracks Simulator

##Premise

Warcraft III is a famous strategy video game by Blizzard. In this game, players can build barracks and then use them to train footmen which they can later use to fight other players' units.

We're going to use OOP to model out Warcraft III's unit training for the Human Race. You'll be reading XCTest examples to determine what functionality needs to be built and then build it to make all the tests pass or else the Human race will die!

NOTE: The logic will not be identical to that of Warcraft III... deal with it!

##Instructions

There are multiple test files provided. Each file progresses our development of the game further. Start by opening the project.

Show the navigator panel (command+0) and navigate to the "Test Navigator" tab (command+5). Here, you'll see all the tests grouped by file. After you run each test, you will see the status for each (red x for fail, green checkmark for success). Your goal is the make all the tests pass for that file, before proceeding onto the next test file. Start by mousing over "WarcraftIII_Tests_01" and clicking on the small arrow button (looks like play).

##Steps

1. Read the CODE for the test file that you ran
2. Understand what tests it contains and what each test in that file is expecting
3. Start implementing your code to satisfy a particular test ("example")
4. Run the test suite again (control+option+command+g).
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 until all tests pass for that suite.
6. Once all the tests are passing for that suite, run the next suite (file). (Note: the test suites may not be listed in order; please choose the next numbered test file)

##Notes / Tips:

In this assignment, you will only be reading/running XCTest files, not creating or modifying them.
As such, do not modify the code in the test files
The tests will require you to create new classes as you progress. This means you should create a new file for that class (good practice, and what this project is already doing and expecting)
Normal projects do not have their tests structured this way. We've done it here to facilitate incremental building and learning

It is recommended that you consume these resources and understand their underlying concepts before starting the project:
